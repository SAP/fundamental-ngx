    <!-- 
      <ng-content> approach does not work with "overflow" as we have to assign 
      "fd-toolbar-item" directive to each fd-button to make it working.
      The ContentChildren(FdButton) list approach with rendering in the template 
      does not work as we can not access FdButton projected content and render it here
      withing a loop.
      We need to find a way to make button projected content available here to keep 
      control over its rendering in order to make working overflow and force some options
