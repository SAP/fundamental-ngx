<description>
    The <code class="code-snipper">@fundamental-ngx</code> packages are supplied with i18n capabilities. Specifically
    the <code class="code-snipper">@fundamental-ngx/i18n</code>
    package allows you to dynamically change the language of your application and it can be used with any translation
    library of your choice.
    <br />
    <br />
    By default, the English language is used. You may switch to other predefined languages we supply, partially modify
    them or provide your own translations entirely. See examples below.
