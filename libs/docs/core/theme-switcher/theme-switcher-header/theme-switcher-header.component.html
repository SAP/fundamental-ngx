        DEPRECATED. ThemeService has been deprecated since 0.35.0 version in favor of
        <a routerLink="/core/theming">ThemingModule and ThemingService</a> which provides more flexibility and
        functionality to the developers.

        Theme switcher API allows user to set specific theme programmatically. There is no longer need for each
        application to implement its own theme switcher code.<br />
        At the moment this won't work for Internet Explorer 11. We will enhance this feature in the near future.<br />
        The API requires additional assets from the npm packages: <code>@sap-theming/theming-base-content</code> and
        <code>fundamental-styles</code>.<br />
        Prerequisites - add those objects to assets array in <code>angular.json</code>:<br />
