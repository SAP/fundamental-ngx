                The word pineapple in English was first recorded in 1398, when it was originally used to describe the
                reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed pine cones). When European explorers discovered this
                tropical fruit they called them pineapples (term first recorded in that sense in 1664) because of their
                resemblance to what is now known as the pine cone. The term pine cone was first recorded in 1694, and
                was used to replace the original meaning of pineapple.
