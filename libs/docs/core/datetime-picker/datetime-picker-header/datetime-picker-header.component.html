        <p>
            The datetime picker component is an opinionated composition of the fd-popover, fd-calendar and fd-time
            components to accomplish the UI pattern for picking a date and time.
            <br /><br />
            The datetime picker supports the same keyboard navigability as the calendar and time components. The popover
            can be opened by focusing the datetime picker input field and closed by focusing the icon button followed by
            pressing enter or space.
            <br /><br />
            Fully compatible with Angular forms.
