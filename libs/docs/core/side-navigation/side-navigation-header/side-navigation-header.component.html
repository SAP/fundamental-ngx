        >The left navigation can always display or expand/collapse using the menu icon within the global navigation.<br /><br />
        Side navigation anchors are keyboard navigated, it can be achieved by <code>ArrowDown</code>,
        <code>ArrowUp</code>, and basic <code>Tab</code>. Sub-levels of tiered side navigation can be opened with the
        space bar, enter key or right arrow.<br /><br />
        Expanded state: Only the selected item itself, be it a first-level or second-level item, shows the selection
        indication.<br /><br />
        Collapsed state: The first-level item shows a selection indication either when itself or one of its
        second-level/children items is selected.<br /><br />
        Collapsed with Popover: When a Popover is shown, both the first-level item in the Side Navigation, as well as
        the selected second-level item in the Popover, both show the selection indication. <br /><br />
