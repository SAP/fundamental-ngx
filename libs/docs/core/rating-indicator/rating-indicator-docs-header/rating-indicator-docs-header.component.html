            The rating indicator can be used to rate content or to indicate a rating. It enables users to rate an item
            on a numeric scale. The most popular scale is 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        </p>

        <h3>When to Use</h3>
        <p><strong>Do</strong> use the rating indicator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you want to collect quantitative user feedback in the form of star ratings (for example, for user
                satisfaction surveys or product reviews).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you need a visually appealing way to showcase the popularity or quality of items, products, or
                content.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Don't</strong> use the rating indicator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the content you're presenting doesn't lend itself to user ratings (for example, legal documents,
                terms of service, or non-interactive content).
            </li>
            <li>
                If adding a rating indicator introduces unnecessary complexity to your UI, especially when you don't
                anticipate much user interaction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selected icon:</strong> Indicates the rating. At least one element must be selected.</li>
            <li><strong>Icon not selected:</strong> Indicates non-active rating states.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic text:</strong> Dynamic text that shows the rating.</li>
            <li><strong>Icon read-only:</strong> Indicates non-active rating states in read-only mode.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>States</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Regular state:</strong> The active, editable state where users can select or change the rating.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Disabled state:</strong> The inactive state, in a faded style showing the rating cannot be
                interacted with.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Read-only state:</strong> The fixed state where the rating is visible to users but cannot be
                altered.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Number of Rating Symbols</h3>
        <p>
            You can specify the total number of rating symbols (stars) using the <code>size</code> input, with 5
            recommended but up to 7 possible.
