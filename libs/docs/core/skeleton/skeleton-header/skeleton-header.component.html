    <description>
        Skeleton is the component to show loading placeholders to give hints about a structure of the page before the
        actual content is loaded.

        <br /><br />

        Skeletons should be be used as less as possible and cover only the heavy dynamic parts, please consider that any
        lightweight static data should be shown immediately.
