        The Side Navigation can display structures of up to three levels.

        <h2>In the Wide variant:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first levels always shows an icon</li>
            <li>If first-level items have children, they show the expand/collapse arrows</li>
            <li>Second level items do not display an icon and are not indented</li>
            <li>If second-level items have children, they show the expand/collapse arrows</li>
            <li>Third level items do not display an icon and are indented by 2 rem (32px)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In the Narrow variant:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first levels always shows an icon</li>
            <li>If first-level items have children, they show the expand/collapse arrows</li>
            <li>
                If first-level items have children, and they are clicked, the popover displays the First-level item in
                bold letters, then the second level items in regular.
            </li>
            <li>Second level items do not display an icon and are not indented</li>
            <li>If second-level items have children, they show the expand/collapse arrows</li>
            <li>Third level items do not display an icon and are indented by 2 rem (32px)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A note about height:</h2>
        It is advised to place the side nav in a container of fixed height, or have it occupy the full height of the
        screen. Otherwise the height of the side nav will change based upon the expanding and collapsing of items with
        children.
