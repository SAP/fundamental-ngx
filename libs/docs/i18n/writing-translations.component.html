        Translations consist of two parts: the translation identifier and the translation itself. The translation
        identifier is a string that is used to identify the translation. The translation itself is the string that is
        displayed to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        The format in which the translation is written depends on the type of the loader. If you are loading
        translations from a JavaScript object, then it can be a function too, along with a string.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's take example from Platform Upload collection translation identifiers. They have a prefix
        <code>platformUploadCollection</code>. Whole list of the identifiers can be found in the
        <a routerLink="/platform/upload-collection/i18n" fd-link>upload collection i18n documentation page</a>. For the
        sake of the example, let's take a small list of them from English translations file:
    </p>
    <fd-code-snippet [file]="jsonExample"></fd-code-snippet>
    <p>
        Here, in the list above, we see 4 translation variants: a simple string, a string with a placeholder, with
        internal references and
        <a href="https://support.crowdin.com/icu-message-syntax" fd-link target="_blank">ICU expression</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you'd loaded translation strings using the JavaScript object, you'd have access to functions as well and
        above example would take the following form:
    </p>
    <fd-code-snippet [file]="jsExample"></fd-code-snippet>
    <p>
        The JavaScript object is a valid translation source, but it is not the most convenient one if you want to
        translate your application using a translation service. For that, you need to use format, which is represented
        by the raw strings in the example above. The format is called
        <a href="https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/" fd-link target="_blank">ICU Message Syntax</a>, and
        it is a standard for the translation strings. It is supported by most of the translation services, and it is the
        recommended format for the translations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our translation interpolations are using
        <a href="https://formatjs.io/" fd-link target="_blank">formatjs</a>
        library, which is the most popular ICU Message Syntax implementation for JavaScript.

    How does internal references work?
</fd-docs-section-title>
<description>
    <p>
        Internal references are used to reference other translations. When our translations resolver finds a reference,
        it tries to find the translation for the reference and replace the reference with the translation, if it is
        found. Then it assembles one big ICU Message Syntax string and passes it to the formatjs library for the
        interpolation. One thing to note is that if referenced translation needs some context, then the context is also
        needed for the referee translation. For example, if we have a translation
        <code>platformUploadCollection.folderNamePluralization</code>
        and it is referenced in another translation
        <code>platformUploadCollection.messageRemoveFoldersAndFilesFailed</code>
        , then the
        <code>platformUploadCollection.messageRemoveFoldersAndFilesFailed</code>
        translation needs to have minimum the same context as the
        <code>platformUploadCollection.folderNamePluralization</code>
        translation, otherwise the interpolation will fail.

    How to escape <code>{{ '{' }}</code> and <code>{{ '}' }}</code> characters?
</fd-docs-section-title>
<description>
    <p>
        If you need to use <code>{{ '{' }}</code> or <code>{{ '}' }}</code> characters in your translation, you need to
        wrap them in single or double quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if your translation needs to be <code>{{ fromToCodeTranslation }}</code> and your contexts are
        <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>, then your translation will look like this:
        <code>{{ fromToCode }}</code>
    </p>
