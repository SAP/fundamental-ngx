            <code>DataSourceDirective</code> is a standalone directive that includes most common logic when working with
            the data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since it's a standalone directive, users don't need to manually apply it to a desired component. This can be
            done with <code>hostDirectives</code> object of the <code>@Component</code> or
            <code>@Directive</code> decorator.
        </p>
        <p>
            It handles opening and closing the data stream with the help of the class that implements
            <code>DataSourceParser</code> interface.
        </p>
        <p>This class can be provided via <code>FD_DATA_SOURCE_TRANSFORMER</code> Injection Token.</p>
        <p>
            Additionally, it will emit events when the data inside data provider has been changed, or the data source
            object has been changed completely.
