        Radio buttons provide users with a set of mutually exclusive options. They allow a user to select only one
        option from two or more choices. Each option is represented by a radio button. Consequently, radio buttons only
        work in groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can set <code>[isGroup]="true"</code> to make the radio button take the whole width of the parent container.
        This way all radio buttons in a group will have the same width. By default, the width of the radio buttons is
        set to "fit-content".
