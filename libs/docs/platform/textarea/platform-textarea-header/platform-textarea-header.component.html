        The text area is an input control that allows the user to enter several lines of text.
        <br />
        This text area is specially designed to work with Platform Forms, although it can be used by itself as well in
        conjunction with <a routerLink="/core/textarea">Fundamental ngx core's</a> form directives to achieve similar
        results.

        <br />
        <br />

        <import module="PlatformTextAreaModule" subPackage="form"></import>

        <br />

        <h2>Platform specific enhancements:</h2>
        1. Textarea can automatically grow its height by specifying the max number of rows, or height to which it can
        grow.
        <br />
        2. A counter message that counts the number of remaining or exceeded characters.
        <br />
        3. Various interaction behaviours when counter exceeds the number of maximum characters.
        <br />
        4. Support for internationalisation of counter message.
