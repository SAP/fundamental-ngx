<description>
    <p>One of the scenarios of using Platform Table component, is to render the large amount of items.</p>
    <p>Storing this amount directly in memory may lead to a browser performance issues.</p>
    <p>
        In order to keep the performance on a normal level, Platform Table component supports lazy loading of the items
        on scroll, and reusing rendered row components for row items.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, Platform Table component supports lazy loading for a child row items.</p>
    <p>
        For this, developers need to pass Data source class that retrieves row's children into
        <code>[childDataSource]</code> input property.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> due to complexity of the children lazy loading logic, [childDataSource] can only
        accept classes derived from <code>TableChildrenDataProvider</code>.
    </p>
    <p>This example shows combination of virtual scroll and lazy loading for item on each level.</p>
