            The icon tab bar comprises a series of tabs that each link to a different content area or view. You can use
            it for navigation within an object, or as a filter. There are two key use cases: You want to let users
            navigate between different object facets in the object details area. You want to let users filter lists, and
            give them the option of calling up the entire list, or only items with a specific attribute. In both cases,
            the user switches between tab pages by clicking the respective tab.
