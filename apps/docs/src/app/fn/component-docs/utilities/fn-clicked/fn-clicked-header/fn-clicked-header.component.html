        During development of the components, which should be accessible we encounter a lot of the repeated cases. One
        of them is interaction detection. Besides "click" event, both "space" and "enter" can be indication of user's
        will to select something. This is correct in most cases. Because of that need, we implement those three handlers
        manually all the time. To eliminate that much repeated code we wrote custom Angular Event manager. Syntax is
        very simple, just like you'd write <code>(click)="onClickHandler($event)"</code>, you will write
        <code>(fnClicked)="onClickHandler($event)"</code>
        and it will catch both "keydown.enter" and "keydown.space" events alongside with regular "click" event.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>(fnClicked)</code> also works with <code>@HostListener</code> decorator and with
        <code>Renderer2.listen</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Include <code>ClickedBehaviorModule.forRoot()</code> in <code>imports</code> array of your <b>Root</b> module to
        have access to the event handler.
