<header>Approval Flow</header>
<description>
    The Approval Flow component is a complex component which tracks and manages the approval process for a business
    object. From the Approval Flow component a user is able to:
    <ul>
        <li>See the progress of approvals</li>
        <li>Add, edit and delete approvers</li>
        <li>Add, delete and move approvals</li>
        <li>Add and remove watchers</li>
        <li>Send reminder notifications to approvers</li>
    </ul>
    The only limitation, for now, it's that the process cannot have multiple final nodes (there should be only one).
