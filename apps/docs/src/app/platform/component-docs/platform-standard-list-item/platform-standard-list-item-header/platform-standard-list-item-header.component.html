            Standard List Item is used for less complex datasets (for example, when the user selects an item in a
            dialog). It consists of an optional image, a title, description, and a single info text, which can contain
            semantic information. This component makes use of <a routerLink="/core/list">list-item</a> directive present
            in fundamental-ngx/core and has additional enhancements on top of it.
