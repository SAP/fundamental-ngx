        Thumbnail is an image with a reduced file size that is used as a placeholder for full sized multimedia content.
        The
        small file size of thumbnails makes it possible for website designers to offer visitors a lot of content
        immediately
        without increasing the loading time of the page. Clicking on the thumbnail takes you to the media content in
        original size, which can be opened in a bigger media slot.
