    >List in Platform is built on top of List component present in <a routerLink="/core/list">list-item</a>.
    <p>
        In fundamental-ngx/core, features like title, icon, secondary data, footer, group header are exposed as
        directives which provides more freedom to developers to assemble the List component. In Platform it is
        implemented as item components hiding the internal complexity from application developer. It abstracts out the
        assembling part making it easier to use.
    </p>
