        >List in Platform is built on top of List component present in <a routerLink="/core/list">list-item</a>.
        <p>
            In fundamental-ngx/core, features like title, icon, secondary data, footer, group header are exposed as
            directives which provides more freedom to developers to assemble the List component. In Platform it is
            implemented as item components hiding the internal complexity from application developer. It abstracts out
            the assembling part making it easier to use.
        </p>
