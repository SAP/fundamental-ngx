<fd-docs-section-title id="basic" componentName="i18n"> Basic usage </fd-docs-section-title>
<description>
    If your app is in English, you don't have to do anything - components will load English language by default. In
    order to use any other language, you will need to provide an object, that implements <code>FdLanguage</code>
    interface in the root of your app.

<fd-docs-section-title id="language-customization" componentName="i18n">
    Customizing language per component
</fd-docs-section-title>
<description>
    <p>In order to provide language customizations per component, use <code>fdLanguagePatch</code> directive.</p>
    <p>
        Also it's possible to easily override global language for a certain component by providing
        <code>FD_LANGUAGE</code> token at any child scope. Use <code>patchLanguage</code> utility function for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> you should understand that providing an injection token in a certain module will affect the scope,
        were this module is imported. Thus it's recommended to provide overrides on the level of components or lazy
        loaded modules.

<fd-docs-section-title id="language-change" componentName="i18n"> Changing languages at runtime </fd-docs-section-title>
<description>
    <p>
        <code>FD_LANGUAGE</code> token is an observable, which means you can change the language at runtime using your
        own logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this particular example such capabilities are shown on the level of a component due to the limitations of the
        example itself. The same scenario can and should be used in the root of your app.

    Creating custom translations
</fd-docs-section-title>
<description>
    <p>
        Although <code>fundamental-ngx</code> library provide rich set of languages to work with out of the box, it's
        possible to also define own languages when needed. The language object is just a set of key/values, that are
        defined per component. This object should implement <code>FdLanguage</code> interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may provide both strings with interpolation using double curly brackets (<code>
            {{ '{{ paramName }}' }}</code
        >) or functions as language values.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list of available keys can be found in the corresponding docs section of each component (I18n section is
        visible only for the components that have translations). You also can find there English value for each
        translation property.
    </p>
