<header>Select</header>
<description>
    The select component was created to emulate the native select element as closely as possible while also providing
    more extended styling options. Note that even with the effort already invested in making this component accessible,
    it will never match the native select which is directly supported by screenreaders.
    <br /><br />
    To view the styled native select, visit the <a [routerLink]="'/form'">Form</a> page.
