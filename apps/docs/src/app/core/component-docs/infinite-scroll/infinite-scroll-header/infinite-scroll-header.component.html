        Infinite scroll is a generic <strong>directive</strong> which can be used to load more elements as the user
        scrolls
        down a parent container. It is particularly useful when dealing with large lists which cannot be queried at the
        same
        time. This directive allows you to only query more elements when the scrolling reaches a certain point.
        <br /><br />
        Inside the ngOnInit method of the directive, an observable is created from the scroll event of the element which
        the
        directive is attached to. It then monitors the scrolling and emits an event when the inputted percentage value
        is
        reached.
