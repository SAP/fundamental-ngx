<header>Infinite Scroll</header>
<description>
    Infinite scroll is a generic <strong>directive</strong> which can be used to load more elements as the user scrolls
    down a parent container. It is particularly useful when dealing with large lists which cannot be queried at the same
    time. This directive allows you to only query more elements when the scrolling reaches a certain point.
    <br /><br />
    Inside the ngOnInit method of the directive, an observable is created from the scroll event of the element which the
    directive is attached to. It then monitors the scrolling and emits an event when the inputted percentage value is
    reached.
