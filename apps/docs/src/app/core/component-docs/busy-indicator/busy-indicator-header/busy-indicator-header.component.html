<description>
    The busy indicator informs the user about an ongoing operation.
    Try to avoid showing multiple busy indicators at
    once.

    Use the busy indicator if:
    <ul>
        <li>The ongoing operation covers only part of a screen that has multiple controls</li>
        <li>You need to display additional information or the user needs to be able to cancel the operation</li>
    </ul>

    Do not use the busy indicator if:
    <ul>
        <li>The operation takes less than one second</li>
        <li>You need to block the screen because the user is not supposed to start another activity. In this case, use
            the busy dialog
        </li>
    </ul>
