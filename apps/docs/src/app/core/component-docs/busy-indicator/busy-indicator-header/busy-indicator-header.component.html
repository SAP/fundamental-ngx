        The busy indicator informs the user about an ongoing operation. Try to avoid showing multiple busy indicators at
        once. Use the busy indicator if:
        <ul>
            <li>The ongoing operation covers only part of a screen that has multiple controls</li>
            <li>You need to display additional information or the user needs to be able to cancel the operation</li>
        </ul>

        Do not use the busy indicator if:
        <ul>
            <li>The operation takes less than one second</li>
            <li>
                You need to block the screen because the user is not supposed to start another activity. In this case,
                use the busy dialog
            </li>
        </ul>
