    DEPRECATED. ThemeService has been deprecated since 0.35.0 version in favor of
    <a routerLink="/core/theming">ThemingModule and ThemingService</a> which provides more flexibility and functionality
    to the developers.

<description>
    Theme switcher API allows user to set specific theme programmatically. There is no longer need for each application
    to implement its own theme switcher code.<br />
    At the moment this won't work for Internet Explorer 11. We will enhance this feature in the near future.<br />
    The API requires additional assets from the npm packages: <code>@sap-theming/theming-base-content</code> and
    <code>fundamental-styles</code>.<br />
    Prerequisites - add those objects to assets array in <code>angular.json</code>:<br />
