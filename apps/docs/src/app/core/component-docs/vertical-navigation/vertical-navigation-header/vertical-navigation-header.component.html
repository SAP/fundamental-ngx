<description>
    The Vertical Navigation can be used as an alternative to the Horizontal Navigation.<br />
    This navigation type is composed by two distinct item levels:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            First Level items - always visible, can be either navigable in and of themselves or be a container for
            Second Level items (it should not be both)
        </li>
        <li>
            Second Level items â†’ Are always contained by a First Level item, and can have their visibility toggled by
            this First Level item. They are always only navigable
        </li>
    </ul>
