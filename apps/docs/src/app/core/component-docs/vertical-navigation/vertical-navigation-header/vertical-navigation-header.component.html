        The Vertical Navigation can be used as an alternative to the Horizontal Navigation.<br />
        This navigation type is composed by two distinct item levels:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                First Level items - always visible, can be either navigable in and of themselves or be a container for
                Second Level items (it should not be both)
            </li>
            <li>
                Second Level items → Are always contained by a First Level item, and can have their visibility toggled
                by this First Level item. They are always only navigable
            </li>
        </ul>
