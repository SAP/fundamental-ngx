    Notifications are the best way to make users aware of a situation that requires timely action or attention. This could be a situation that has just arisen or a task triggered by a workflow.
    <br><br>
    <b>Use notifications in the following cases:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>To make users aware of situations that require attention.</li>
        <li>To reduce the amount of information and the number of actions to a minimum, but provide enough information to help users decide if the information is important.</li>
        <li>The notification list items and notification list groups are only used in the SAP Fiori notifications popover.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Users access notifications by clicking the bell icon in the shell bar at the top right of the screen. In the notifications popover, the user can order notifications in various ways, take action, and navigate to the source of a specific notification.<br>
        High-priority notifications are shown using the banner. The banner appears on the upper right-hand corner of the screen for a short period of time and then disappears. It's recommended to set a notification to high priority if you need to get the user’s immediate attention. In this case you need to use the NotificationService and pass the content of the notifications as a template or a component.
