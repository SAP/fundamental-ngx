    Resizable card layout enables users to define a personalized card layout by changing size of the card as well as
    position of the card using Drag-and-drop(in-development).
    Whenever the size of a card changes,layout adapts to fit it most compact way possible.
    <br />
    <br />
    It offers different views of the card content for different dimensions of the various card types. For example, you
    can show more items, zoom in or out, or change the granularity of a dataset.

    Resizable card layout has following features:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cards can be resized vertically in rows of 1 rem and horizontally in steps of 20 rem.
        </li>
        <li>
            A card can be resized horizontally using right edge of card, it can be resized vertically using bottom edge
            of card and it can be resized horizonatlly as well as vertically Simultaneously using resize handler at
            right bottom corner.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whenever card is resized, it has more/less space to display data. So data displayed can be adjusted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Card also can be made Non-resizable by using <code>resizable=false</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            To avoid states with cut or unsubstantial content, there are no resizing steps between mini-header and
            mini-content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Vertical resize of card has below thresholds:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mini Header:<br /></strong>
                    The smallest representation of the card is the header. The card can be collapsed to only its header
                    height.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mini Content:<br /></strong>
                    The minimum height for the card content depends on the card type, and must be as high as the
                    smallest representation of the content. In a list card, for example, first list item needs to fit
                    in.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
