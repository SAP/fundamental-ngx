    <p>
        The object identifier is a short text that represents the key identifier of an object, and can be displayed in
        various types of containers, tables, panels, popovers and more. The text wraps if there is insufficient horizontal space.
    </p>
    <p>
        The object identifier should be easily read by the users, preferably displaying text instead of an ID.
        If it necessary to distinguish objects by their IDs, then it should appear as descriptive text below the title text.
