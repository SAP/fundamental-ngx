        The datetime picker component is an opinionated composition of the fd-popover, fd-calendar and fd-time
        components to accomplish the UI pattern for picking a date and time.
        <br /><br />
        The datetime picker supports the same keyboard navigability as the calendar and time components. The popover can
        be opened by focusing the datetime picker input field and closed by focusing the icon button followed by
        pressing enter or space.
        <br /><br />
        Fully compatible with Angular forms.

        <br />
        The Date Time Picker component relies on provided datetime implementation (DatetimeAdapter) and datetime formats
        (DateTimeFormats).
        <br />
        The current examples are based on FdDatetimeAdapter.
        <br />
        The FdDatetimeAdapter is based on native date api (formatting is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">
            Intl object </a
        >, parsing is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse">
            Date.parse() </a
        >).
        <br />
        Since this adapter has some disadvantages, formatting may vary among browsers and parsing is limited to en
        locale only.
        <br />
        You can use a custom fundamental adapter based on a third party library:
        <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">https://momentjs.com/</a>.
        <br />
