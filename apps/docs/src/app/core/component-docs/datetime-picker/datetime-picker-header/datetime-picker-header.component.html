<header>Datetime Picker</header>
<description>
    The datetime picker component is an opinionated composition of the fd-popover, fd-calendar and fd-time components to
    accomplish the UI pattern for picking a date and time.
    <br /><br />
    The datetime picker supports the same keyboard navigability as the calendar and time components. The popover can be
    opened by focusing the
    datetime picker input field and closed by focusing the icon button followed by pressing enter or space.
    <br /><br />
    Fully compatible with Angular forms.
