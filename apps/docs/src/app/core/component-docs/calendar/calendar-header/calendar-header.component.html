<header>Calendar</header>
<description>
    Commonly used as the contents of a popover when composing “date-picker”, rarely used on its own as a standalone
    component.
    <br /><br />
    The Time Picker component <strong>relies on provided datetime implementation</strong>
    (<code>DatetimeAdapter</code>).
    <br /><br />
    The calendar header buttons are navigable with the tab key. Pressing enter or the space bar when the month or year
    is focused will change the day selection grid to the month or year selection grid respectively. The user can then
    tab into the day/month/year selection grid and use the arrow keys to navigate around the grid and make a selection
    with the space bar or enter key.
