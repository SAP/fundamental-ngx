<header>Calendar</header>
<description>
    <p>
        Commonly used as the contents of a popover when composing “date-picker”, rarely used on its own as a standalone
        component.
        <br /><br />
        The calendar header buttons are navigable with the tab key. Pressing enter or the space bar when the month or
        year is focused will change the day selection grid to the month or year selection grid respectively. The user
        can then tab into the day/month/year selection grid and use the arrow keys to navigate around the grid and make
        a selection with the space bar or enter key.

        <br />
        The Calendar component relies on provided datetime implementation (DatetimeAdapter) and datetime formats
        (DateTimeFormats).
        <br />
        The current examples are based on FdDatetimeAdapter.
        <br />
        The FdDatetimeAdapter is based on native date api (formatting is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">
            Intl object </a
        >, parsing is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse">
            Date.parse() </a
        >).
        <br />
        Since this adapter has some disadvantages, formatting may vary among browsers and parsing is limited to en
        locale only.
        <br />
        You can use a custom fundamental adapter based on a third party library:
        <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">https://momentjs.com/</a>.
        <br />
        Please check examples and documentation on:
