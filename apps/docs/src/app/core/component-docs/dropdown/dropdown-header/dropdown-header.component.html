    DEPRECATED. Dropdown component has been deprecated, we recommend to use
    <a [routerLink]="'/core/popover'" [fragment]="'dropdown'">Menu Button</a> instead.

<description
    >The dropdown component is an opinionated composition of the “fd-popover” and “fd-menu” components with the use of a
    styled button. It allows users to make one selection from a list. It is more flexible than the normal Select.
    Generally, it should be used when there are between 3 to 10 or more options.
    <br />
    <br />This component is completely composed from other components. <br /><br />
    The dropdown can be opened via keyboard by pressing enter or the space bar when focused. Dropdown menu items are not
    automatically tab-indexed - see the Menu component documentation for more details.
