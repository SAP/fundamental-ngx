        The popover is a wrapping component that accepts a “control” as well as a “body".
    </p>
    <p>
        A control can be anything that you want to trigger the interaction from. The body will be the contents of what
        you reveal on the page after triggering the popover. Commonly used as the interaction/wrapping component when
        composing “dropdowns”, “contextual menus”, “mega menu”, etc, when paired with the menu component.
    </p>
    <p>
        The popover body can have optional Header, Subheader and/or Footer. When the Header is used with a Subheader,
        the Header should set the [hasSubheader] property to "true". Header, Subheader and Footer have compact mode
        which is available by setting the [compact] property to "true".
    </p>
    <p>
        As a general rule, it is suggested that one popover be revealed on the page at any given time. Opening one
        popover should close all others to prevent multiple layers and collisions of several popovers.
