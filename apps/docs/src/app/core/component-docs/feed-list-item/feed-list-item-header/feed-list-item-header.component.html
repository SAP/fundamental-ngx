        The feed list item control displays text accompanied by an optional user image. You can combine it with the Feed Input control to implement a simple feed or notes control.‌<br />
        The Feed List Item provides a standard UI for 'feeds' where multiple users publish information on regular basis on a certain topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> It’s also possible to display rich text (formatted text) in the feed list item. Use <strong><em>isRichText</em></strong> field. This feature should be handled with care as it allows for countless custom layouts.<br/>
            Please see that you use it responsibly and provide your users with a consistent experience. Only deviate from the default layout and font if absolutely required by the use case.<br />
            If you activate formatted text, More/less buttons will be hidden and you will see your note fully.
