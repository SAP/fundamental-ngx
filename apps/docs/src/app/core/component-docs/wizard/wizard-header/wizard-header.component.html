    The wizard guides a user through a long or unfamiliar task by dividing it into sections, revealing information in an
    easy and digestible way. It consists of a walkthrough screen, where the user is prompted to input required
    information and upon completing a section, the next sections subsequently follow in a prescribed order; and the
    summary page, where the form is displayed in read-only mode for assessment and final submission.
