        The wizard guides a user through a long or unfamiliar task by dividing it into sections, revealing information
        in an
        easy and digestible way. It consists of a walkthrough screen, where the user is prompted to input required
        information and upon completing a section, the next sections subsequently follow in a prescribed order; and the
        summary page, where the form is displayed in read-only mode for assessment and final submission.
