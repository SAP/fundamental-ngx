        Themeable scrollbar is the scrollbar component made accordingly to the Fiori 3 design guidelines.<br />
        Using the themeable scrollbar is preferred over the browser's default in the components that support having
        scrollbars and made accordingly to the Fiori 3 design guidelines.<br />
        Themeable scrollbar works in Chrome, Safari, and other WebKit\Blink-based browsers and partially works in
        Firefox
        (no hover effects).<br />
        Component is not working in the IE, default scrollbar is shown instead.
