    Content Density can be maintained app-wide using the <code>ContentDensityService</code>, and components can
    subscribe to a <code>BehaviorSubject</code> managed by the service and use that to handle changes to the content
    density. Before using it, you should add <code>ContentDensityService</code> to providers array to
    <code>AppModule</code>, or other root module in your application.
    <br />
    Note that many components only come in one size, and others (such as the button below) only have
    <code>compact</code> and <code>cozy</code> sizes, so setting the size to <code>condensed</code>
    will have same effect as compact.
    <br />
    All components that have content density options will first check to see if the developer has provided a
    <code>compact</code> input value, and if not, it will then refer to the value set in the
    <code>ContentDensityService</code>.
