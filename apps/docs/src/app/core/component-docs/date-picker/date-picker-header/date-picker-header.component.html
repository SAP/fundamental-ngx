<header>Date Picker</header>
<description>
    The date picker component is an opinionated composition of the "input-group", "popover" and "calendar" components to
    accomplish the UI pattern for picking a date.
    <br /><br />
    The date picker supports the same keyboard navigability as the calendar. The calendar can be opened by focusing the
    date picker input field and closed by focusing the calendar icon button and pressing enter or space.
