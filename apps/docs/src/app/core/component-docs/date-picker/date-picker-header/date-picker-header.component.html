    <p>
        The date picker component is an opinionated composition of the "input-group", "popover" and "calendar"
        components to accomplish the UI pattern for picking a date.
        <br /><br />
        The date picker supports the same keyboard navigability as the calendar. The calendar can be opened by focusing
        the date picker input field and closed by focusing the calendar icon button and pressing enter or space.

        <b>IMPORTANT</b>
        <br />
        The Date Picker component relies on provided datetime implementation (DatetimeAdapter) and datetime formats
        (DateTimeFormats).
        <br />
        The current examples are based on FdDatetimeAdapter.
        <br />
        The FdDatetimeAdapter is based on native date api (formatting is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">
            Intl object </a
        >, parsing is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse">
            Date.parse() </a
        >).
        <br />
        Since this adapter has some disadvantages, formatting may vary among browsers and parsing is limited to en
        locale only.
        <br />
        You can use a custom fundamental adapter based on a third party library:
        <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">https://momentjs.com/</a>.
        <br />
