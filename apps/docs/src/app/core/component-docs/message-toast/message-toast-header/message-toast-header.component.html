    >Message Toast is a small, non-disruptive popup for success messages that disappears automatically after a few
    seconds. <br /><br />

    <b>Usage</b><br />
    Use Message Toast in the following cases:<br />
    - To display a short success message. <br />
    - To avoid interrupting the user while they are performing an action.<br />
    - To confirm a successful action.<br /><br />

    <b>Position</b><br />

    The message toast is always centered horizontally at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />

    <b>Behavior and Interaction</b><br />

    The message toast fades in and out automatically. The timing and duration of the message toast is defined by the
    app. The standard value is 3000 ms. The duration can be set to more than 3000 ms, but it's not recommended to set it
    to less than 3000 ms.
