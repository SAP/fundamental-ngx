    <p>
        The message toast is a small, non-disruptive popup for success messages that disappears automatically after a
        few seconds. When message toast is displayed, it is always centered horizontally at the bottom of the screen and
        fades in and out automatically. <br /><br />
        <b>Note:</b> The timing and duration of the message toast is defined by the application, the standard value
        being 3000 ms. The duration can be above 3000 ms, but it's not recommended to be less than 3000 ms.
