            The time component is used for a single time value. Multiple components can be used in the time-picker to
            assemble a clock time. A max of four will account for hours, minutes, seconds and period of the day. It will
            be rare to see this component used outside of it being composed in the time-picker component.
            <br /><br />
            Time component buttons are navigable via the tab key and can be pressed via the space bar or enter key.
