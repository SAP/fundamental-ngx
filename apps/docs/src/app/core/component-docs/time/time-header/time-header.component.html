        The time component is used for a single time value. Multiple components can be used in the time-picker to assemble a
        clock time. A max of four will account for hours, minutes, seconds and period of the day. It will be rare to see
        this component used outside of it being composed in the time-picker component.
        <br /><br />
        Time component buttons are navigable via the tab key and can be pressed via the space bar or enter key.

        <br>
        The Time Picker component relies on provided datetime
        implementation (DatetimeAdapter) and datetime formats (DateTimeFormats).
        <br>
        The current examples are based on FdDatetimeAdapter.
        <br>
        The FdDatetimeAdapter is based on native date api (formatting is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat">
            Intl object
        </a>, parsing is based on
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse">
            Date.parse()
        </a>).
        <br>
        Since this adapter has some disadvantages,
        formatting may vary among browsers and parsing is limited to en locale only.
        <br>
        You can use a custom fundamental adapter based on a third party library: <a href="https://momentjs.com/"
            target="_blank">https://momentjs.com/</a>.
