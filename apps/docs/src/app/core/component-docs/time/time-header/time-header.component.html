<description>
    The time component is used for a single time value. Multiple components can be used in the time-picker to assemble a
    clock time. A max of four will account for hours, minutes, seconds and period of the day. It will be rare to see
    this component used outside of it being composed in the time-picker component.
    <br /><br />
    The Time Picker component <strong>relies on provided datetime implementation</strong>
    (<code>DatetimeAdapter</code>).
    <br />
    Currently fundamental-ngx offer 2 kind of adapters: 
    FdDateTimeAdapter and <a fd-link routerLink="/core/moment-datetime-adapter">MomentDateTimeAdapter</a>.
    <br /><br />
    Time component buttons are navigable via the tab key and can be pressed via the space bar or enter key.
