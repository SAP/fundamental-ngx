    <description>
        <p>
            The responsive splitter layout structures complex applications into defined areas. These areas may be
            resizable
            and are either distributed on one screen or across different areas, which may also be off-canvas. This
            depends
            on the device class and the requirements and settings of the application.
        </p>

        <p>
            The defined areas are resizable manually, programmatically, and/or by external function holders such as
            buttons
            or menu entries. These areas and their parent containers are parts of the responsive splitter control and
            have
            properties that can be changed to meet an application’s need.
