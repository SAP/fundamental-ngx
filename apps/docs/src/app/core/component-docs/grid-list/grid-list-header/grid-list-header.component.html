<header>Grid List</header>
<description>
    As with the list and the responsive table, the grid list displays a set of items. In contrast to both controls, the
    grid list displays the items not in rows, but in a grid. The grid list is usually used as an alternative view for a
    list or table. It is ideal for displaying images, charts, object cards, and other content, which profit from more
    height (but less width).

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <h4>Use the grid list if:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Your content is “visual” and profits from the rectangular format of the items. This is true for e.g. images,
            charts, and object cards.
        </li>
        <li>The focus is on items, not on cells. The grid list shows complete items.</li>
        <li>You want to display a homogeneous set of basic data.</li>
        <li>You need to sort, group, or filter simple data sets.</li>
        <li>As an alternative view for tables or lists, if the content profits from the different format.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Do not use the grid list if:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Your content is not appropriate for a card-like format. For example, do not use the grid list for displaying
            a wall of text. Use a table instead.
        </li>
        <li>
            The main use case is to select one item from a very small number of items, without viewing additional
            details. In this case, a select or combo box might be more appropriate.
        </li>
        <li>Data needs to be structured in a hierarchical manner. In this case, a tree might be more appropriate.</li>
        <li>You need an overview of a large amount of data. In this case, use a chart.</li>
        <li>
            You want to manage complex datasets that need to be extensively sorted, grouped, filtered, or edited. In
            this case, use a table.
        </li>
    </ul>
