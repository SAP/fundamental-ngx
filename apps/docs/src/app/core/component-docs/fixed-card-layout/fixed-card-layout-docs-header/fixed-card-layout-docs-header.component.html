    <description>
        The fixed card layout supports automatic, easy and fast card design. The cards are ordered in responsive and
        collapsible columns. The cards are arranged into a “Z” flow: from left to right, starting with the first card on
        the
        top left of the page. The maximum number of columns is 10.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Layout available size change can be detected when angular triggers change detection. For example
                <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-resize-event/" target="_blank">angular-resize-event</a>
                can
                be used for detecting layout size change and then angular can trigger change detection. Using which
                Fixed
                card layout will be able to re-distribute card.

            <li>
                Drag'n'Drop feature by default has delay of 200 ms after pointer down and before dragging is started.
                That's
                made to avoid breaking scrolling on mobile devices with touch screen. In case you need to change this
                behavior, use <code>dragStartDelay</code> input property.
