<header>Fixed Card Layout</header>
<description>
    The fixed card layout supports automatic, easy and fast card design. The cards are ordered in responsive and
    collapsible columns. The cards are arranged into a “Z” flow: from left to right, starting with the first card on the
    top left of the page. The maximum number of columns is 10.

    <b>Notes:</b> <br />

    <ul>
        <li>
            Layout available size change can be detected when angular triggers change detection. For example
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-resize-event/" target="_blank">angular-resize-event</a> can
            be used for detecting layout size change and then angular can trigger change detection. Using which Fixed
            card layout will be able to re-distribute card.
        </li>

        <li>
            Drag'n'Drop feature by default has delay of 200 ms after pointer down and before dragging is started. That's
            made to avoid breaking scrolling on mobile devices with touch screen. In case you need to change this
            behavior, use <code>dragStartDelay</code> input property.
        </li>
