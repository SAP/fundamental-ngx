                The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit 
                and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. 
                The pineapple is indigenous to South America, 
                where it has been cultivated for many centuries. 
                The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th 
                century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. 
                Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in 
                greenhouses and many tropical plantations.
