<header>Dialog</header>

    <p>
        The dialog is used as a container to be displayed in response to an action. It is commonly used to collect
        simple information with a short form, to get confirmation or display contextual information
        that does not require a page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dialogs make use of a singleton service called DialogService. It provides the ability to open() dialog windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        The open() method accepts either a TemplateRef or Component as dialog content. In addition, you may optionally
        provide a DialogConfig object to override some system-default dialog window behaviours.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a dialog window is opened, the content is positioned in a parent element that is appended to the body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Importing one of BrowserAnimationsModule or NoopAnimationsModule is required. The first is the standard Angular
        animation module, it animates content as expected. NoopAnimationsModule mocks the animations and does not render
        them, potentially increasing performance.
