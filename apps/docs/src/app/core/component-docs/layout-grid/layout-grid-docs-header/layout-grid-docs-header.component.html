<header>Layout Grid</header>
<description>
    The layout grid is made to separate data into both columns and rows. If there is not enough space on the current
    line of the same row, the item will go to the next line without the margin at the top. The grid can be made
    responsive, so it is useful for building layouts at any screen size.
