The Modal component utilizes a singleton ModalService to handle opening/closing of the modal. In your component, you'll
need
to create a method that calls ModalService's open() function. First, import the service with
<code>import {{ '{' }} ModalService } from 'fundamental-ngx';</code>. Then inject the service into your component's
constructor with
<code>private modalService: ModalService</code>. Then you'll need to call
<code>this.modalService.open(modalName)</code>. Use
<code>this.modalService.close()</code> to close the modal.
