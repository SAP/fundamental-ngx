<header>Dropdown</header>
<description>The dropdown component is an opinionated composition of the “fd-popover” and “fd-menu” components with the
    use of a styled
    button. It allows users to make one selection from a list. It is more flexible than the normal Select. Generally, it
    should
    be used when there are between 3 to 10 or more options.
    <br>
    <br>This component is completely composed from other components.
    <br/><br/>
    The dropdown can be opened via keyboard by pressing enter or the space bar when focused.  Dropdown menu items are not
    automatically tab-indexed - see the Menu component documentation for more details.
